# Aunty Acid's Guide to Mayhem
This is my portfolio 3 project for the Code Institute Full-stack developer course.

Aunty Acid's Guide to Mayhem is a simple application designed for event creation. Mainly focused on underground and lesser known artists and promoters working with them. Even small venues could benefit from this. The whole idea is to create a platform for people to quickly upload the event information which then gets stored for later use on a front-end application with search functionality. It is often extremely hard to find smaller shows in cities. The hope is that the creation of a groundroots DIY application focussing on cfostering a community that can easily follow and explore new music and in such a way grow the music scene. If we are honest, all "big bands" need to come from somewhere. If we do not try and grow the smaller scenes there will be nothing left for future generations to enjoy.
